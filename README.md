# advent-of-code-2024

This is my first time doing the Advent of Code. I will be utilising the [Go](https://go.dev/) programming language to solve the problems as a learning opportunity.

I will not be going back to previous day solutions and improving or refactoring them, so that I can see the progress I make throughout the event.
